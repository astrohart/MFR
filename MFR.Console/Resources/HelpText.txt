xyLOGIX Project File Renamer - Command Line Tool
Copyright (c) 2021-22 by xyLOGIX, LLC.  All rights reserved.

This utility basically serves as a "find and replace but for Solution Explorer" whereby
we can rename files and folders (and the references to them) in projects within the current
solution or all Visual Studio solutions in a given folder.

Usage:

mfrc.exe --root="C:\path\to\root\dir" --findWhat "Hello world" --replaceWith "Boo hoo"
	[--renameFiles|--renameSubFolders|--replaceInFiles]

Command-line arguments:

Parameter								Meaning
----------								---------
-r
--root									(Required.) Sets the directory that this application begins in.
										Defaults to the current working directory.  If the folder contains
										more than one .sln file (searched recursively), then each 
										solution found is processed.  If the folder contains no solution
										files, then the application shows an error message and quits;
										at least one solution file must be present in the folder indicated
										in order for the software to work.


--findWhat								(Required.) Sets the string to be found in file system entries.

--replaceWith							(Optional.) May be the empty string.  Sets the string to be
										substituted in file system entry names.

--renameFiles							(Optional.) If specified, instructs the software to rename
										files in accordance with the --findWhat and --replaceWith
										values.  This operation is not done if this flag is not passed.

--renameSubFolders						(Optional.) If specified, instructs the software to rename
										subfolders of the starting folder in accordance with the
										--findWhat and --replaceWith flags.  This operation is not
										done if this flag is not passed.

--replaceInFiles						(Optional.) If specified, performs replacement in files,
										allowing for multi-dotted strings aka for Visual Studio
										project names.  This operation is not done if this flag
										is not passed.

--matchCase								(Optional.) If specified, then the search for what to replace
										is case-sensitive.  The default value is true.

--matchWholeWord						(Optional.) If specified, then the search is done only for
										whole-word matches.  The default value is false.

--help									Displays this Help text.

NOTE: If neither the --renameFiles, --renameSubFolders, nor the --replaceInFiles flags are specified,
the program presumes the user wishes to do all these operations by default.
