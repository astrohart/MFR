[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Provides objects and functionality to track the open Visual Studio Solution (*.sln) files loaded in various instances of Visual Studio, and to close and open them in the Visual Studio instances that have them open.  The thinking is that the file renaming and find/replace operations that are requested cannot take place unless the corresopnding Visual Studio Solution is not open in an instance of Visual Studio. However, this being said, we want to keep track of which solutions were open in what instance of Visual Studio, in case the user specifies that all Solutions closed by the application are to be reopened upon completion of the processing.  This particular library holds the factories for this component.")]
