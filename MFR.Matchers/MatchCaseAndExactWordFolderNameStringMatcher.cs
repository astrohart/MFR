             * which are delimited by a backslash ('\').   We just want to perform
             * a search on the folder farthest down the directory tree of the given
             * path.
             *
             * For example, if we have the path 'C:\I\am\a\folder', we just want
             * to match on the word 'folder'.   Assuming the 'value' parameter is a
             * fully-qualified, absolute pathname to a folder, we call System.IO.
             * Path.GetFileName(value) to get the folder furthest down the
             * directory tree, and then do an "Equals" search on it against the
             * value of the 'findWhat' parameter.             *
